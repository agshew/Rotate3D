# **App Name**: Rotate3D

## Core Features:

- 3D Object Display: Display a 3D object that the user can rotate.
- Quaternion Rotation: Implement quaternion-based rotation of the 3D object, responding to user inputs.
- Euler Angle Rotation: Implement Euler angle-based rotation of the 3D object, responding to user inputs.
- Coordinate Axes Visualization: Display coordinate axes to visualize orientation.
- Rotation Mode Switch: Enable switching between quaternion and Euler angle rotation modes.
- Gimbal Lock Explanation: Provide on-screen explanation of the concept of Gimbal lock, and describe when it's happening in the Euler mode using a tool.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Dark gray (#222222) to highlight the 3D object and coordinate axes.
- Primary color: Bright blue (#3498db) for the 3D object to ensure visibility against the dark background.
- Accent color: Yellow (#f1c40f) for the coordinate axes to provide contrast and clarity.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for clear labels and UI elements.
- Keep a clean and minimalistic layout.
- Implement smooth transitions between rotation modes for a seamless user experience.
