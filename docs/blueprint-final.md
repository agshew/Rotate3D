# App Name: Rotate3D - Final Blueprint

This document reflects the final state of the Rotate3D application after a series of iterative developments. It captures the current features and design, highlighting the evolution from the initial concept.

## Core Features (Current Implementation)

- **Side-by-Side 3D Scene Display**: The application prominently features two distinct 3D scenes displayed next to each other for direct comparison.
- **Independent Rotation Modes**:
  - **Quaternion Scene (Left)**: Displays a 3D model rotated using quaternions, ensuring smooth and predictable rotations that are immune to gimbal lock.
  - **Euler Scene (Right)**: Displays a 3D model rotated using Euler angles, which is susceptible to and used to demonstrate the principles of gimbal lock.
- **Gimbal Visualization**: The 3D object has been replaced by a set of nested, color-coded gimbal rings (Red for X, Green for Y, Blue for Z) and a central payload. This provides a much clearer mechanical analogy for how Euler rotations work.
- **Isolated Controls**: Each scene has its own dedicated set of sliders (X, Y, Z) and live value readouts, ensuring their states are completely independent.
- **Automated Gimbal Lock Demonstration**: A dedicated "Demonstrate Gimbal Lock" button for the Euler scene runs a multi-step animation that:
  1. Rotates the Y-axis gimbal to 90 degrees.
  2. Pauses to show the state.
  3. "Wiggles" the X-axis and Z-axis rotations independently to clearly show how they produce the same undesirable "wobble," demonstrating a loss of a rotational degree of freedom.
- **Simultaneous Demonstration**: A primary "Run Simultaneous Demonstration" button triggers both the quaternion and Euler animations at the same time, offering a stark, side-by-side contrast between the two rotation systems.
- **Gimbal Lock Explanation**: An alert box appears when the Euler cube is manually placed in a gimbal lock state, explaining that a degree of freedom has been lost.

## Style Guidelines

- **Background color**: Dark gray (`#222222`) to highlight the 3D objects.
- **Gimbal Colors**:
    - **X-Axis Ring**: Red
    - **Y-Axis Ring**: Green
    - **Z-Axis Ring**: Blue
- **Primary color (UI)**: Bright blue (`#3498db`) for interactive elements.
- **Accent color (UI)**: Yellow (`#f1c40f`) for highlights.
- **Font**: 'Inter' sans-serif for a clean, modern UI.
- **Layout**: A minimalistic, two-column layout that separates the visual demonstration from the controls and explanation.

## Key Differences from Original Blueprint

The final application evolved significantly from the initial concept based on iterative feedback.

1.  **Dual Scene vs. Single Scene**: The original plan was for a single 3D view with a mode switch. The final version uses a more effective side-by-side comparison.
2.  **Gimbal Rings vs. Cube**: The initial idea was to use a simple cube. The final version uses color-coded, nested gimbal rings, which provides a far superior visualization of the mechanics of Euler rotations.
3.  **Isolated vs. Shared Controls**: The concept evolved from shared controls to completely separate controls for each rotation mode to prevent state conflicts and provide a clearer demonstration.
4.  **Automated & Refined Animation**: The gimbal lock demonstration went from a simple animation to a sophisticated, multi-step sequence that explicitly "wiggles" the affected axes to make the lock unmistakable.
5.  **Simultaneous Demo Button**: This was added to streamline the user experience for direct comparison.
6.  **"Shadow Cube" Removed**: An intermediate concept of a "shadow cube" was implemented and later removed in favor of the more effective side-by-side layout.
